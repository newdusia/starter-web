## Introduction

As the orgasm took hold of her, it was as though every nerve in Jessica’s body ignited at once. Her breath caught in her throat, and a deep, uncontrollable moan escaped her lips. She felt her body tighten and pulse around Steve, waves of pleasure crashing over her, pulling her deeper into the moment. Her hips moved on their own, pressing against him as if her body was seeking even more of him, more of the connection they shared. It was overwhelming—her mind lost in the pure physicality of it, the heat, the intensity.

Her muscles clenched, the feeling almost unbearable in its sweetness. She could feel the warmth of her own arousal flowing, coating him, amplifying the sensation of every slight movement between them. She pressed closer, her hips grinding as the climax rippled through her, each wave more powerful than the last. The sensation of him so intimately inside her, even just the tip, felt maddening. The vulnerability of it—the bareness, the openness—only intensified the pleasure.

## Purpose

Steve could feel it—Jess’s body tightening around him, her breath becoming ragged, her hips pressing desperately into his as the orgasm took over. He had felt her getting closer, the subtle shifts in her breathing, the way her body seemed to respond to every slight movement he made. When the moment hit, he held her tightly, feeling the way her body squeezed him, her warmth flooding over him, coating him in her wetness.

Her high-pitched moan was like music to his ears, a sound that confirmed everything he had been waiting for. He felt her shudder, her hips rocking instinctively, and the pressure against the bare head of his cock was almost too much. It was an incredible sensation—her body giving in, her pleasure so raw and real. He had been with other women, but something about this moment with Jess felt different, more profound.

## Deployment

Jess’s body was still trembling, the aftermath of her orgasm sending residual shudders through her limbs. Her breath came in shallow gasps, her chest rising and falling against Steve's as the intensity of the moment lingered in the air. She could feel her heart pounding, the rush of blood in her ears, and her skin felt overly sensitive to every touch. Even the soft brush of the sheets against her bare skin felt heightened. Her grip on Steve's shoulders was tight, her fingers digging into his skin as though she needed to hold onto him to steady herself, to anchor herself to something real in the wake of what she had just experienced.

Steve's arms were strong around her, holding her close, as if he knew exactly how vulnerable she felt in that moment. His whisper was a steady, grounding force. "You're incredible, Jess. Just breathe. I've got you." His voice was low, soft, soothing. It wrapped around her like a blanket, easing some of the tension in her body but also stirring something deeper within her. His words, gentle yet full of intent, made her feel cared for in a way she hadn't expected.

Jess’s lips parted, and a soft sigh escaped her. "Steve… I can’t stop shaking," she whispered, her voice fragile, barely above a breath. She could still feel the trembling in her legs, the lingering pulse of her climax resonating through her, and the weight of Steve’s body against hers was the only thing keeping her grounded. She felt so open, so raw.
